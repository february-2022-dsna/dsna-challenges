Implement `at`
---

JavaScript has a new array method `at`. It's not yet available in all browsers, but you can write your own!

## Rules

You can't use `array.at`, implement your own using:

Property | Example
---|---
Read element by index | `const item = arr[i];`
Read array length | `const length = arr.length;`

## Challenge

Write a function `at` that takes an array and an index and returns the item at corresponding index. **However**, negative indices should work _from the back of the array_.

```js
  function at(arr, index) {
    //we are given all the things, and the things do things
    //we are given the array and the index wanted, and should return the item at that index point
    //if the number is positive the index is read left to right
    //if the number is negative, the index is read right to left
    if (index >= 0 ) { //the index given is greater than or equal to 0
      return arr[index]; //returns the item in the index place
    } if (index < 0) { //the index is less than 0
      return arr[arr.length - (index * (-1))] //we take the negative index, make it a positive and subtract it from the length of the array
    }
  }
```

## Test Cases

Input | Output 
---|---:
`['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`, `1` | `'b'` 
`['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`, `-2` | `'d'`
